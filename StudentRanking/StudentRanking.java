     Next you must display the student id number, the gpa, and the studentâ€™s class

     students who have a better gpa. So, for example, if the student's rank is 27,
     it means that there are 26 other students who have a gpa that is better than
     the student with rank 27. Please output all the students in the order they
     are in the input file such as: example:
     
     S316542 3.45 27 
     S29463 1.42 801 
     S969870 2.75 T64 with 8 others
      
      Notice that the rank for the last student indicates T64 which means that
      there are 63 students with a gpa better than this student. It also indicates
      that this student's gpa of 2.75 is the same as 8 other students (there are
      are total of 9 students with a 2.75 gpa). In other words, this student is
      tied for 64th place with 8 other students.
